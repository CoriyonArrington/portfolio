                <h2>Back to where it all began.
                </h2>
                <p>Introduction to Engineering Design. That‚Äôs where it all started for me. It was a class taught by one of my favorite professors, Dr. Howard. He was on the team that created SolidWorks, a computer-aided design program that millions of people use. For the first time in my life, I was starting to understand that everything around me had to go through a design process. I was doing that by creating 3D models in SolidWorks. Coolest. Thing. Ever.
                </p>
                <p>One day he had us watch an episode of 60 minutes. It was focused on a company called IDEO that‚Äôs widely known as a design and consulting firm. It showed a day in their life as they observed people, made sketches, and created prototypes. Instantly, I was in love. They were enjoying themselves and helping solve real world problems at the same time. That inspired me. The idea of creating things that people use AND enjoy.

                <h2>‚ÄúThe most important thing is try and inspire people.‚Äù - Kobe
                </h2>
                <p>Same time next year I was helping teach that Engineering Design class. Unfortunately, there was not a major called Engineering Design so I decided to go with Biomedical Engineering. By the time I reached my upperclass biomedical courses I knew I didn‚Äôt love it. I was burned out and had no clue what to do next. I only knew that it was not going to be biomedical related. So, I decided to move across the U.S. and try something new.

            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>From Engineering to Facebook?!
                </h2>
                <p>Enter Facebook. I moved to Austin and helped clients with their ads and investigated broken features. It was different from what I was used to but getting outside your comfort zone is where the growth happens. That experience opened the door for me to manage accounts for GoDaddy on a larger scale. I worked with hundreds of clients as they used the product. However, I noticed that in each role I was only able to identify issues after the fact, and I wanted to help before it got to that point.
                </p>
                <p>Like most people, I wanted something different.  I wanted to get to what I saw on that one episode of 60 minutes all those years ago. So, I started researching and I ran into UX Design! UX Design is the perfect intersection of technology, research, and creativity - all the aspects of my skill set I enjoy using.

                <h2>The journey is just beginning!</h2>
                <p>That brings me today, I am wrapping up an intensive UX design program with Bloc.io. I can honestly say that I‚Äôm in love with it and it feels like what I‚Äôm meant to be doing. I appreciate the user research - seeing why people make the choices they do. I admire the visual aesthetics - finding the perfect balance in a design. I even geek out over the frontend coding, which my mentor told me I‚Äôm crazy for since many designers don‚Äôt. I feel at home and energized as I work on my projects. If you want to chat about design please reach out.
