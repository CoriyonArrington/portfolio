          <h2>Back to where it all began.</h2>
          <p>
            Introduction to Engineering Design. That‚Äôs where it all started for
            me. It was a class taught by one of my favorite professors, Dr.
            Howard. He was on the team that created SolidWorks, a computer-aided
            design program that millions of people use. For the first time in my
            life, I was starting to understand that everything around me had to
            go through a design process. I was doing that by creating 3D models
            in SolidWorks. Coolest. Thing. Ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day he had us watch an episode of 60 minutes. It was focused on
            a company called IDEO that‚Äôs widely known as a design and consulting
            firm. It showed a day in their life as they observed people, made
            sketches, and created prototypes. Instantly, I was in love. They
            were enjoying themselves and helping solve real world problems at
            the same time. That inspired me. The idea of creating things that
            people use AND enjoy.
          </p>
          <h2>
            ‚ÄúIf you're afraid to fail, then you're probably going to fail.‚Äù -
            Kobe
          </h2>
          <p>
            Same time next year I was helping teach that Engineering Design
            class. Unfortunately, there was not a major called Engineering
            Design so I decided to go with Biomedical Engineering. By the time I
            reached my upper class biomedical courses I knew I didn‚Äôt love it. I
            was burned out and had no clue what to do next. I only knew that it
            was not going to be biomedical related. So, I decided to move across
            the U.S. and try something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter Facebook. I moved to Austin and helped clients with their ads
            and investigated broken features. It was different from what I was
            used to but getting outside your comfort zone is where the growth
            happens. That experience opened the door for me to manage accounts
            for GoDaddy on a larger scale. I worked with hundreds of clients as
            they used the product. However, I noticed that in each role I was
            only able to identify issues after the fact, and I wanted to help
            before it got to that point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most people, I wanted something different. I wanted to get to
            what I saw on that one episode of 60 minutes all those years ago.
            So, I started researching and I ran into UX Design! UX Design is the
            perfect intersection of technology, research, and creativity - all
            the aspects of my skill set I enjoy using.
          </p>
          <h2>The journey is just beginning!</h2>
          <p>
            That brings me to today, I am wrapping up an intensive UX design
            program with Bloc.io. I can honestly say that I‚Äôm in love with it
            and it feels like what I‚Äôm meant to be doing. I appreciate the user
            research - seeing why people make the choices they do. I admire the
            visual aesthetics - finding the perfect balance in a design. I even
            geek out over the frontend coding, which my mentor told me I‚Äôm crazy
            for since many designers don‚Äôt. I feel at home and energized as I
            work on my projects. If you want to chat about design please reach
            out.

            P.S. - I found that old episode, if you ever need some motivation I
            highly recommend checking it out üëáüèæ
