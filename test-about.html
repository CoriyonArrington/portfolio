                <h2>Back to where it all began.</h2>
                <p>
                    Introduction to Engineering Design. That‚Äôs where it all started for me. It was a class taught by one of my favorite professors, Dr. Howard. He was on the team that created SolidWorks, a computer-aided design program that millions of people use. For the first time in my life, I was starting to understand that everything around me had to go through a design process. I was doing that by creating 3D models in SolidWorks. Coolest. Thing. Ever. 
                    One day he had us watch an episode of 60 minutes. It was focused on a company called IDEO that‚Äôs widely known as a design and consulting firm. It showed a day in their life as they observed people, made sketches, and created prototypes. Instantly, I was in love. They were enjoying themselves and helping solve real world problems at the same time. That inspired me. The idea of creating things that people use AND enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>‚ÄúThe most important thing is try and inspire people so they can be great in whatever they want to do.‚Äù - Kobe</h2>
                <p>
                    Same time next year I was helping teach that Engineering Design class. Unfortunately, there was not a major called Engineering Design so I decided to go with Biomedical Engineering. By the time I reached my upperclass biomedical courses I knew I didn‚Äôt love it. I was burned out and had no clue what to do next. I only knew that it was not going to be biomedical related. So, I decided to move across the U.S. and try something new.
                    Enter Facebook. I moved to Austin and helped clients with their ads and investigated broken features. It was different from what I was used to but getting outside your comfort zone is where the growth happens. That experience opened the door for me to manage accounts for GoDaddy on a larger scale. I worked with hundreds of clients as they used the product. However, I noticed that in each role I was only able to identify issues after the fact, and I wanted to help before it got to that point.
