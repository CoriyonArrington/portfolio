            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to start out the journey by creating a user survey
              because I wanted to figure out what features users prefer most in
              their cloud storage app and what features they would mainly use.
              This helped me to see that most people use more than one app
              likely because they use them for different purposes. More
              importantly, it helped me prioritize what features to include for
              a minimum viable prototype - mobile upload & sharing an item.

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              From there, I decided to take a deeper look at what people were
              already using because I wanted to understand why they chose those
              particular apps. I also wanted to get a better idea of how to
              implement those two main features, mobile upload and sharing an
              item. Based on the survey, most people were using Google Drive,
              Dropbox, and iCloud so I chose to start there.

                <img src="../images/icloud.png" alt="iCloud" />

            </div>
            <p>
              I noticed that Google Drive and Dropbox placed the add button
              somewhere near the bottom on mobile devices and on top for the
              web. I figured they have done a ton of research already and my
              final design would most likely have similar button placement.
              However, they differed in how users shared files. Google Drive had
              a shared button on the tab bar whereas Dropbox users needed to
              click into files in order to share. This made me consider the
              possibility of making that process more efficient and streamlined.

              the user to life and I referred back to them as I was designing

            <h3>User Stories and Flows</h3>
            <p>
              They say you should never start building without having a
              blueprint. So, I decided to complete some user stories so I could
              have a clear idea of all the actions that a user would go through.
              I used the data from the survey and the goals from the personas to
              find help me prioritize them. I prioritized them this way because
              doing so helped me to efficiently create the minimum viable
              prototype.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>As a new user I want to create an account</li>
              <li>As a new user I want to upload images</li>
              <li>As a new user I want to share items by sending a link</li>
              <li>As a returning user I want to see my files</li>
              <li>As a returning user I want to edit items</li>
              <li>As a returning user I want to see available free space</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The user stories were then converted into user flows using
              Whimsical to illustrate how the user would interact with the
              product and accomplish those goals.

            <h3>Digital Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Once the user flows were complete, it was time to start exploring
              the design. I went to the drawing board and got to work. The
              survey results showed me that more people preferred uploading from
              mobile versus computer. So, I decided to design for mobile first.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose to focus on a few key areas in the design: the tab bar,
              the add button, and seeing files visually. For the tab bar, I
              wanted the user to quickly access the features they use most such
              as searching for a file and sharing a file. So, I decided to
              include them in a place where they will always see those options -
              the tab bar. Given that users want to add files quickly, I chose
              to place the add button at the top of the screen where they could
              see it first.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I focused on ways that users could see their files
              visually. I decided to have two places, the top where they could
              slide through recent and the body where they could see albums. The
              first draft prototype was completed using InVision and can be seen
              below.

              Eclips Storage was inspired by modern looks from other designers.
              The goal is to have the users perceive the product as modern. The
              rest of the guidelines below will show how modern aspects are used
              to achieve this goal such as the use of tan accents colors often
              found in modern interior design.

            <h3>Color</h3>
            <p>
              Dark orange and dark cyan are the main colors of Eclips Storage.
              Orange is a color that invokes a feeling of happiness and is
              associated with joy, happiness, and creativity. Blue represents
              confidence, intelligence, trust, and loyalty. All of which are
              important when it comes to saving personal files somewhere that
              can’t be seen. The goal is to have users trust the brand while
              enjoying the process of using its product. The accent colors were
              chosen because they are often found in modern interior design. The
              use of the lighter accent colors helps the primary colors to pop
              while not clashing.

              Outerorbit was chosen as the brand typeface and Quicksand was
              chosen to complement it as the main text. They were selected
              because they are a great combination of the older font styles that
              come to mind when thinking of cloud storage and a more modern look

            <h2>Iterations</h2>
            <p>
              Eclips Storage went through a few rounds of user testing. I
              decided to test once the digital wireframes were complete because
              I was looking for any major design changes that needed to be
              corrected before spending more time on it. I asked users to test
              it by trying to complete the following actions:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create an account</li>
              <li>Add some content</li>
              <li>Organize the content</li>
              <li>Share the content</li>
              <li>Sign out of the account</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              It revealed some areas that needed to be corrected. For example,
              it showed me that users wanted to be able to share directly from
              the file and choose where it would go as opposed to going through
              multiple steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I implemented the feedback from the first round of user testing,
              added the visual design and then completed the round of user
              testing.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              Thanks to the great feedback, I was able to increase the usability
              score from 66 to 82. I received overwhelmingly positive feedback
              from the users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nonetheless, I wanted to continue to improve the app so I went
              through a quick round of preference testing. I was having a hard
              time figuring out which main color to use throughout the app. I
              wanted some insight on other UI parts like the search bar.
            </p>
            <p>
              The preference testing was able to clear most up that by showing
              me statistically what users prefer.

            <h2>The Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              There are still aspects I would continue to improve and refine if
              given more time. For example, I would have worked on making a
              light and dark version of the app. I would love to see how each
              performs in user testing, specifically more preference testing.
              Additionally, I designed the app primarily for mobile since the
              user research showed that users would upload from mobile more.
              However, they would still use a computer so I would enjoy spending
              time designing the web version as well.
            </p>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>
              I learned so much from working on this project. I made mistakes
              along the way like not thinking through what additional screens
              would be needed to complete a process. Case in point, the original
              process for sharing an item was very wonky now that I look back on
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my biggest takeaways was learning how designs files need to
              be laid out for developers. Now I know that the handoff is
              extremely important and it is key to include the developers early
              on because they can help fill in gaps. It’s important to organize
              files to make the transition easier and keep everything named in a
              specific manner. I’m happy to have a better understanding of how
              that works.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another major area I learned was the branding. I figured out that
              branding, as open as it is., can still be boiled down to some
              science. Once there’s a process for doing the research and putting
              together the mood boards the branding can come together much
              easier. I plan to use the processes I learned in future projects
              like finding name generators and color palette generators to spark
              inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, I learned a ton and I am incredibly happy with the way
              it turned out. I’m looking forward to the next journey.
