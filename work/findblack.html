            <p>
              In the aftermath of George Floyd, people have wanted to support
              black-owned businesses. However, there are not many apps or tools
              that help connect people to black-owned businesses, products, or
              services. There are a few problems that exist though.

            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to start out the process by creating a user survey on
              Google Forms because I wanted to test my assumptions and see if
              people were having an experience similar to mine. When George
              Floyd was killed, I found myself wanting to support black
              businesses even more than usual. There were tons of "check out
              these" lists available but finding a black business nearby was
              difficult to say the least. So, the user survey helped me to get
              insight.
            </p>
            <div class="project-example">
              <h4>Survey Highlights</h4>
              <h5>Out of 65 participants</h5>
              <p>
                <span>95% </span>of people would use a tool designed primarily
                for finding black-owned businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>70% </span> of those who searched for a black business
                before said they search at least two times a month.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>57% </span>said that finding black businesses was very
                hard or somewhat difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Searching by business type </span> was the top requested
                feature.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Incorrect search results </span>ranked as a top pain

            <p>
              This showed me that there was a need for people to find
              black-owned businesses and there is an opportunity to improve the
              experience.

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              The competitive analysis was crucial to the process. My main goals
              and reasons for doing the analysis were:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Identify all major competitors</li>
              <li>Discover pros and cons for each</li>
              <li>Find areas to distinguish FindBlack</li>
              <li>Understand marketing, branding, and positioning</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              To my surprise, there were a lot more out there than I was
              expecting. Even as I continued throughout the project I would find
              more. I noticed that most of them were for finding restaurants
              though. Even still, the ones that were centered around finding any
              type of business were usually not designed very well or had many
              bugs. I was able to narrow down my competitors to the three below.

            <p>
              This was important because it gave me a baseline to work from. I'm
              a big advocate for not reinventing the wheel and working hard to
              understand how to improve what's already out there. Below are a
              few product shots from the competitors that show some common
              similarities such as a tab that has the main functions, a search
              bar, and business cards showing the business info. Going into the
              project, I knew I would test and incorporate these aspects.

                out of all 65 participants 89% were women.
              </span>
              I was expecting it to be majority women but not by that much. It
              showed me that the app would be primarily designed for them.

                  As a Social Media Manager and black woman, I feel it's my duty
                  to make sure I'm spreading awareness with accurate and useful
                  information. I would like there to be a more concise method of
                  finding black-owned businesses so I can help spread the word
                  effectively.

                  There is no streamlined way of finding black owned businesses;

                  certain region or there is not much information on there.

                  With everything that has been happening, I want to do my part
                  and help support the black community. One of the easiest ways
                  I know to do that is by buying their products. Personally, I
                  would use an app to find black-owned businesses so I can buy
                  jewelry and clothes mostly. It'll also help me curate content
                  to showcase their work!

            <h3>User Stories and Flows</h3>
            <p>
              Now that it's been confirmed that there is a need and the audience
              has been determined it's a good time to create user stories to
              highlight the core features of the product.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                As a new user I want to quickly view various business
                categories.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a new user I want to search for businesses by keywords.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a new user I want to view pictures and business information.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a returning user I want to see new business highlights.
              </li>
              <li>As a returning user I want to view favorite businesses.</li>
              <li>
                As a returning user I want to see recommend a business get
                added.

            </ol>
            <p>
              The user stories were then converted into user flows using
              Creately to illustrate how the user would interact with the
              product and accomplish those goals.

            <h3>Digital Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Once the user flows were complete, it was time to hit the drawing
              board. The survey results showed me which features people would
              like to see. Additionally, and most importantly, it showed me
              which ones they would use most often. So, I decided to start
              working on sketches with those priorities in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              People mentioned that they would use a search feature the most.
              So, I focused on ease-of-use with the search functionality,
              showcasing it early on in the new user flow and at the top of
              every screen. Secondly, I made sure there were several categories
              for them to choose to search from as well. These choices can be
              seen in the design below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I took a note from the competitors shown earlier and used
              a tab bar that had the core features: a home screen, search
              button, favorite option, and menu for them to do everything else.

              FindBlack was inspired by George Floyd and the different shades of

              Sinopia #C04F27 Cultured #F5F5F5, the top two colors were chosen
              for FindBlack. Sinopia is a rich brown-red color that evokes a
              sense of strength and reliability. Given how users perceive other
              products as not having enough information or being reliable this
              was important. Cultured is a term used in the black community that
              means well refined and tasteful. It's also an off-white that
              conveys simplicity. Lastly, it complements Sinopia well. For these
              reasons, it was chosen as the second main color of FindBlack.

            <h2>Iterations</h2>
            <p>
              FindBlack went through a multiple rounds of user testing. The user
              testing led the design choices. Below are a few examples
              showcasing the iterations it went through and changes that were
              made.
            </p>
            <div class="project-example col2">
              <img
                src="../images/findblack-feedback-1.png"
                alt="feedback example"
              />
              <img

            </div>
            <p>
              Going into the project, I wanted to put an emphasis on usability
              and one of the choices I made was putting a skip button early on
              in the sign up flow. This allows the user to bypass the onboarding
              and immediately experience the app. However, it was brought to my
              attention that the skip button was heard to see. So, I redesigned
              it included it near the join and sign in button instead. Lastly, I
              changed it from "skip" to "browse as guest" to make the action
              more clear.
            </p>
            <div class="project-example col2">
              <img
                src="../images/findblack-feedback-3.png"

              />
              <img
                src="../images/findblack-feedback-4.png"
                alt="feedback example"

            </div>
            <p>
              In the example above, I received tons of great feedback about the
              business page.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Red - It was mentioned that there were too many "cards" and the
                business page was too long. Coupled with this was the ability to
                get to the contact information sooner. So, I redesigned to
                remove the contact card and instead put the contact icons at the
                top of the page, changing its importance and saving space.
              </li>
              <li>
                Yellow - User feedback showed that there was too much
                information going on in the initial business info section. To
                change this, I added the information to the photo that was
                showcased and used Auto Layout so that if more icons needed to
                be added it could easily be done while maintaining the spacing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Purple - The about section was important because users wanted to
                see the business was legitimately black-owned. One easy way to
                accomplish this is to showcase the about section and show the
                owners. Feedback showed that the read more was hard to see and
                users were not sure how to expand it. So, I changed it nu adding
                an icon instead of the ellipses and it was much more clear.

            <p>
              There are still aspects I plan to continue to improve and refine
              with more time. For example, I received some recent user feedback
              from a Product Designer that my home page should be more of a
              search screen. Initial user feedback did not showcase this but
              it's an interesting point from a product perspective. I plan on
              continuing further iterations with this in mind.
            </p>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>
              One of the most challenging parts of the project was making
              designs that were flexible. For example, I wanted to make sure
              that whatever device it was viewed on that it would look as
              intended. I solved this by learning how to use constraints and
              auto layout effectively. Doing so helped me to create more
              responsive components which led to better overall design and
              structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m very happy and proud of the work I’ve done. I believe I have
              designed for most scenarios and have the core design work done.
              I’m also very glad that I learned about auto layout and
              constraints more in-depth as it will much be easier to update and
              refine the future iterations. I’m looking forward to the next set
              of improvements so please check back soon!
